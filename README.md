# Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Hardware Architecture Simulation with GHDL
In this tutorial I designed and simulated a **hardware architecture for elliptic curve cryptography using GHDL**. **GHDL** is an open source command line simulator for the VHDL language. Refer to **installation_tutorial.pdf** for pre-tutorial installation guidelines.

This repository has the following components:
* **tutorial_instructions.pdf**: Tutorial instructions and exercise description.
* **installation_tutorial.pdf**: Pre-tutorial installation guidelines to install GHDL and GTKWave and run a sample program to verify correct implementation.
* **CE__Hardware_Assignment__2020.pdf**: Report with solutions for the exercises described in tutorial_instructions.pdf.
* **vhdl_files_solutions**: VHDL files used to achieve the results in CE__Hardware_Assignment__2020.pdf.
* **Pictures**: Pictures used in CE__Hardware_Assignment__2020.pdf
