# Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Hardware Architecture Simulation with GHDL
Welcome to the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Hardware Architecture Simulation with GHDL repository!

This project aims to implement and simulate a hardware architecture for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using GHDL, an open-source hardware description language (HDL) simulator. ECC is a widely used public key cryptography system that is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It provides a high level of security and is widely used in various applications, such as secure communication and digital signatures.

In this project, we have implemented ECC using the NIST P-256 curve and have simulated the hardware architecture using GHDL. The hardware architecture consists of modules for point multiplication, point addition, and finite field operations, which are the fundamental building blocks of ECC. The design has been verified using a suite of test cases to ensure its correctness.

This repository has the following components:
* **tutorial_instructions.pdf**: Tutorial instructions and exercise description.
* **installation_tutorial.pdf**: Pre-tutorial installation guidelines to install GHDL and GTKWave and run a sample program to verify correct implementation.
* **CE__Hardware_Assignment__2020.pdf**: Report with solutions for the exercises described in tutorial_instructions.pdf.
* **vhdl_files_solutions**: VHDL files used to achieve the results in CE__Hardware_Assignment__2020.pdf.
* **Pictures**: Pictures used in CE__Hardware_Assignment__2020.pdf.

I hope that this project will be useful for those interested in learning about ECC and hardware design for cryptography. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
